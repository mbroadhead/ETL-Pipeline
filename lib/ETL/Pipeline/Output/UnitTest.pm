=head1 NAME

ETL::Pipeline::Output::UnitTest - Output destination for unit tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ETL::Pipeline;
  ETL::Pipeline->new( {
    input   => ['UnitTest'],
    mapping => {First => 'Header1', Second => 'Header2'},
    output  => ['UnitTest']
  } )->process;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ETL::Pipeline::Output::UnitTest> is an output destination used by the unit
tests. It proves that the L<ETL::Pipeline::Output> role works.

The "data" is stored in memory.

=head1 METHODS & ATTRIBUTES

=head3 records

In B<ETL::Pipeline::Output::UnitTest>, a record is a hash reference.
B<records> stores a list of record (hash references). The list survives after
calling L</finish>. This allows you to check the results of a test after
calling L<ETL::Pipeline/process>.

The list is cleared after calling L</configure>.

=head3 all_records

The B<all_records> method returns a list of all the records. It dereferences 
L</records>.

=head3 number_of_records

The B<number_of_records> method returns the count of records currently in the
list.

=head2 Called from L<ETL::Pipeline/process>

=head3 write_record

Saves the current record into L</records>.

=cut

sub write_record {
	my $self = shift;
	
	$self->_save_current_record( $self->current );
	return 1;
}


=head3 configure

B<configure> doesn't actually do anything. But it is required by
L<ETL::Pipeline/process>.

=cut

sub configure { }


=head3 finish

B<finish> doesn't actually do anything. But it is required by
L<ETL::Pipeline/process>. L</records> persists so that the unit test can check
its values.

=cut

sub finish {}


=head2 Other methods & attributes

=head3 default_fields

Initialize L</current> for the next record.

=cut

sub default_fields { () }
