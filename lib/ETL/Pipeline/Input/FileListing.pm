=head1 NAME

ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing - Input source of a disk folder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ETL::Pipeline;
  ETL::Pipeline->new( {
    input   => ['FileListing', from => 'Documents', name => qr/\.jpg$/i],
    mapping => {FileName => 'File', FullPath => 'Path'},
    output  => ['UnitTest']
  } )->process;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> defines an input source that reads a disk
directory. It returns information about each individual file. Use this input
source when you need information I<about> the files and not their content.

=head1 METHODS & ATTRIBUTES

=head2 Arguments for L<ETL::Pipeline/input>

=head3 from

B<from> tells B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> where to find the files. By
default, B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> looks in 
L<ETL::Pipeline/data_in>. B<from> tells the code to look in another place.

If B<from> is a regular expression, the code finds the first directory whose
name matches. If B<from> is a relative path, it is expected to reside under 
L<ETL::Pipeline/data_in>. An absolute path is exact.

has 'from' => (
	init_arg => undef,
	is       => 'bare',
	isa      => Dir,
	reader   => '_get_from',
	writer   => '_set_from',
);


sub from {
	my $self = shift;

	if (scalar( @_ ) > 0) {
		my $new = shift;
		if (ref( $new ) eq 'Regexp') {
			my $match = Path::Class::Rule->new
				->iname( $new )
				->max_depth( 1 )
				->directory
				->iter( $self->pipeline->data_in )
				->()

			croak 'No matching directories' unless defined $match;
			$self->_set_from( $match );
		} else  { 
			my $folder = dir( $new );
			$folder = $folder->absolute( $self->pipeline->data_in ) 
				if $folder->is_relative;
			$self->_set_from( $folder );

}


=head3 ...

B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> accepts any of the tests provided by
L<Path::Iterator::Rule>. The value of the argument is passed directly into the 
test. For boolean tests (e.g. readable, exists, etc.), pass an C<undef> value.

B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> automatically applies the C<file> filter.
Do not pass C<file> through L<ETL::Pipeline/input>.

C<name> is the most commonly used argument. It accepts a glob or regular 
expression to match file names.

=head2 Called from L<ETL::Pipeline/process>

=head3 get

B<get> retrieves one field about the currently selected file. B<get> can
also return methods from the L<Path::Class::File> object. Any additional
arguments for B<get> are passed directly into the method.

  # ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing fields.
  $etl->get( 'Inside' );
  $etl->get( 'File' );
  
  # Path::Class::File methods.
  $etl->get( 'basename' );

B<ETL::Pipeline::Input::FileListing> provides these fields...

=over

=item Extension

The file extension, without a leading period.

=item File

The file name with the extension. No directory information.

=item Folder

The full directory where this file resides.

=item Inside

The relative directory name where this file resides. These are the directories
below L</from> where the file resides. You can use this to re-create the
directory structure.

=item Path

The complete path name of the file (directory, name, and extension). You can
use this to access the file contents.

=item Relative

The relative path name of the file. This is the part that comes after the
L</from> directory.

=item Object

The L<Path::Class::File> object for this entry.

}


=head3 next_record

Read one record from the file for processing. B<next_record> returns a boolean.
I<True> means success. I<False> means it reached the end of the listing (aka 
no more files).

  while ($input->next_record) {

=head3 configure

L<ETL::Pipeline/process>.
