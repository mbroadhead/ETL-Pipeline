Simplify input sources

WARNING: Loading this new version requires that you rewrite any custom input
         sources. The way that ETL::Pipeline interacts with them has changed.

Move the file processing loop into the input source with a callback to the
ETL::Pipeline object. The object callback performs the transform and load steps.
Input sources were complicated, with several different required methods. It
wasn't clear how these worked together. This change simplifies the code for
new input sources. I expect a lot of input sources and very few output targets.
So it makes sense for the input side to be easier.

Fixed two bugs reported through Github. One was during installation.
Automanifest.pm was missing. The distribution needed the /inc directory which
will always have a copy of the module for installation.

The other bug was with variable interpolation. I used the incorrect syntax.
Fixed the line as suggested by the submitter - jimeUWOshkosh.
